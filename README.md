# Sudoku

  This repository contains the Java class files for a GUI Sudoku game, a runnable jar, and a javadoc with a high level overview
  of the methods / classes in these .java files (to view the javadoc, download the javadoc folder, and open the 'index.html' file in a web     browser).
  
  The game itself was written in Eclipse, using Swing's Mig Layout manager.
  
  If you'd like to try it out, feel free to download the runnable jar in this repository. However, make you have the newest version
  of java before running the jar. You can either double click on the jar to execute it, or go to the command line, and type:
  
      java -jar Sudoku.jar
